# Aerostructures

Aerostructures is a Python package based on the OpenMDAO framework (https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO1) for aerostructural analysis and optimization problems using NASTRAN-95 (https://github.com/nasa/NASTRAN-95) and PANAIR (http://www.pdas.com/panair.html).

The aerostructures package was initially developed by Joan Mas Colomer during a PhD thesis at ONERA and ISAE.
